				The requirements we met for the Gold Medal are as follows:

				Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
				For our Integrated Human Practices, we studied the reasons why men didnâ€™t like to undergo the prostate cancer test. This helped us design better our project and set a strategy for an eventual arrival to the market. You can see more of this here <HL a http://2016.igem.org/Team:TEC-Costa_Rica/Human_Practice/Integrated_Human_Practice o mejor a http://2016.igem.org/Team:TEC-Costa_Rica/HP/Gold>. 

				Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.

				Although we tried validating the BioBrick K1903015 as a criteria for Gold Medal we obtained negative results in the characterization. We could only validate the complete device by DNA sequencing.
