				<p style="text-align: center;">Our project is based on a mutated Cas9 engineered to generate a response mediated by an intein signalling. We designed two versions of the dCas9, each one with a set of hotspots that enable the insertion of our intein system or any other protein of interest.</p>
			</div>	
			<div id="parts" class="container-fluid">
				<h2>BBa_K1903001: dCas9 A</h2>
				<p>This dCas9 includes a Double Terminator and has two protein insertion frames in the amino acids L390 and E802. With structural modeling we found that this two hotspots come close when the dCas9 binds to the target molecule, which could trigger a reaction between the proteins inserted in the sites. This part is designed to be assembled with the protein insertions by a Golden Gate reaction with BbsI.</p>

				<h2>BBa_K1903002: dCas9 B</h2>
				<p>This dCas9 includes a Double Terminator and has two protein insertion frames in the amino acids N588 and N888. With structural modeling we found that this two hotspots come close when the dCas9 binds to the target molecule, which could trigger a reaction between the proteins inserted in the sites.

				<h2>BBa_K1903003: Golden Gate Adapter</h2>
				<p>This parts is composed of a random sequence of 100 base pairs follow upstream and downstream by a BsaI restriction site. The fusion sites for both ends are part of the standard prefix and the suffix. We added a random sequence into the BsaI cut sites to make a sequence easy to detect after a PCR reaction and leading BsaI enzyme digestion.</p>
